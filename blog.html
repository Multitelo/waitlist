        <h2>Who is a Researcher and how do Qwesty help them?</h2>
        <p>
          As a product manager, I understand the pain and struggle of new stage
          Start-up founders, UX designers, UX writers, Market Researchers in
          finding research participants especially those with no community.
          <br />
          It even get daunting as one has to go through the process of finding
          one's target audience, and managing participants which is
          time-consuming and frustrating.
          <br />
          We at Qwesty understood this pain, which is why we're introducing a
          product that will solve the problem.
          <br />
          The pain and frustrations in trying to obtain reliable and useful data
          is what gave birth to Qwesty
        </p>

        <h2>Who is a Participant and how do Qwesty help them?</h2>
        <p>
          But that isn't just where it ends.
          <br />
          What about the research participants? Those that give out this data
          and information to projects and companies. Sometimes, these are just
          busy persons who wants to help businesses make their products better,
          persons who wants to invest in products growth by giving reliable data
          but do get stucked in the boring nature of the process that it begins
          to feel too much of a chore than a benefit.
          <br />

          But that's where Qwesty comes in.
          <br />
          We will make data sharing fun, easy, and engaging. It would be like a
          game, and participants would be rewarded for participating. Our Vision
          is a world where sharing data is something one look forward to. Where
          it's actually fun and rewarding.
