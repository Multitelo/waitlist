      <p>
        You're now part of Qwesty waiting list for researchers! As you already
        know, you aren't going to stand under the Xmas cold waiting for us to
        finish rambling our head on the best way to help you.
      </p>
      <p>So in the meantime, let's have some fun with data.</p>

      <p>
        Which is why, we'll keep you updated on our progress so that you won't
        be one of the victims of that statistics but even you already are, we're
        looking forward to helping you as well.
